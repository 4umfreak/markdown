A super fast, highly extensible markdown parser for PHP
=======================================================

Coming soon.

Will support:

- Default Markdown according to: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax
- Github flavored Markdown: https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown
- Markdown Extra: http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/
- Any mixed Markdown flavor you like because of its highly extensible structure.
- Will allow you to add additional language elements by directly hooking into the parser.
  No possible error-prone post or pre-processing needed.
